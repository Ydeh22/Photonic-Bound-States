We studied the following paper:

Timofeev, I. V., Maksimov, D. N. & Sadreev, A. F. Optical defect mode with tunable Q factor in a
one-dimensional anisotropic photonic crystal. Phys. Rev. B 97, 24306 (2018). 

We then reproduced the graphs present in and created an executable paper in the form of a python notebook.
This project was undertaken by undergraduate sophomore students at the Physics Department at
IIT Bombay as a part of the course PH 202: Waves, Oscillations and Optics
